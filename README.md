# Volatility-calibration

Part 1 - Interpolation

From a table of 10 strikes and 10 prices, I interpolate the data to obtain a surface of price. 
I then use this interpolation to calculate the continuous measure of Breeden-Litzenberger.

Part 2 - Calibration of volatility surfaces.

From the step 1, I obtained an implied volatility surface with newton raphston algorithm with BS formula.  
I compare monte carlo pricing method and black and scholes. 
I calibrate my own pricing surface with monte carlowith Nelder Mead algorithm. 
I improve the calibration by calibrating each parameters vol, vol of vol and hurst exponant. 
As it is hard to calibrate the all surface due to long time computation, I look at a specific point strike 98.3 and maturity = 7 months. 
I also implement a monte carlo with 5 parameters and the Ornstein_Uhlenbeck process. 

Part 3 - Recuit 
I compare antoher calibration algorithm : recuit simul√© with neldermead.
